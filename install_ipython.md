[A short intro](http://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/ipython-a-short-introduction)


* To use ipython for different projects

Make an ipython shortcut in each of your project directories. For example if you have a new project in C:\fake\example\directory, then right click on the shortcut's icon and "Edit Properties."

Set the shortcut's "start in"=the directory of your project. Every time you open the shortcut, the default directory is your project's directory.

* You can use any editor, which is separated from your ipython shell.
